The Davies Project was an effort to increase knowledge about American
university libraries and their collections, begun by Princeton
University President emeritus and Professor of Economics and Public
Affairs Harold T. Shapiro and Stephen Ferguson, Curator of Rare Books
at the Princeton University Library in the 2000.

The project's major accomplishment was a database compiled from the
punch cards used by Professor Haynes McMullen in his decades-long
research into American Libraries before 1876.

The contents of this database are now being made available to
researchers as a data set in X.  A simple view of this data can be
searched and browsed on this site.
