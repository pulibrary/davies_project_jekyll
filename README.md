# Migration of the Davies Project Website

The core asset from the [original
website](https://daviesproject.princeton.edu/) is the database
compiled from punch cards produced by Professor Haynes McMullen in his
research on American Libraries before
1876.  The contents of that database were converted to CSV, as were
some metadata: a key to the library types in the data table, a
glossary of those types, and a bibliography.

These have been retained in the _data directory of this repository.
The rest of the repository contains the files for generating a static
web site using Jekyll.
