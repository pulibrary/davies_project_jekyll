title: American Libraries before 1876
permalink: /alb1876/
---

In forty years of data-collecting and historical research, Professor
Haynes McMullen created a database of statistics about more than ten
thousand American libraries established before 1876, work which
culminated in the publication of a landmark volume entitled *American
Libraries before 1876* (Greenwood Press, 2000).  In a review of this
book, Bill Olbrich called it "perhaps the most significant work of
American library history since those of Jesse Shera and Sidney Ditzion
half a century ago" (Olbrich 2002, p. 132).  Concluding his review,
Olbrich concludes that "the only way McMullen can surpass himself now
is to place the American Library History Database on American
libraries, with names, dates, places, and a detailed bibliography, in
a public-access online database" (p. 137).

The Davies Project responded to Olbrich's challenge in 2004, with the
release of a searchable online database compiled from Professor
McMullen's original research cards and an extensive bibliography of
sources.
